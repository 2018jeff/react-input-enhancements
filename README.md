React component boilerplate

### How to use it

Don't use it.

Seriously, just write your own boilerplate, it's not that hard.
I'm sure it's already outdated anyway. Like any boilerplate.

### Don't tell me what to do. How to install it?

Ugh. Fine.

```
$ npm init

$ npm install

$ npm start

$ open http://localhost:3000
```
